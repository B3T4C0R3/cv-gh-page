The selection is then automatically converted into a quotation and saved in the existing CRM tool. After accepting the quotation, the customer can supply the campaign materials and view statistics via the system. Due to a request for visualization of certain data from IEX, the system has been expanded with a role system. For example, editorial users could see analyzes of their publications and sales users could see the sales figures.","To contribute to the knowledge of the IEX Group development team and to be able to find a suitable front-end framework, an investigation has been done to find out which front-end frameworks are available. Based on data about the most popular front-end frameworks among developers, a selection was made. React, Vue and Angular were possibly suitable candidates. Criteria have been drawn up based on the requirements and wishes of the client and the IEX Group development team. A prototype was also made for all three candidates and a benchmark test was performed on these prototypes. Based on the results of the prototypes, benchmark tests and the criteria, Vue proved to be the most suitable front-end framework. Using this framework, a full-stack prototype could then be developed for the EuroBolBel websites.","Okeezy was a project with which developers could easily set up an authentication system, including a personalized interface, via a web application.
